# ETHz-GML-Notes

My lecture notes for Guarantees in Machine Learning 2021 at ETH Zurich.

See the PDF: [Here](https://github.com/suniique/ETHz-GML-Notes/blob/main/GML_21_notes.pdf). The LaTeX source code is also available in this repository.

This note was made during the 2021 Fall Semester of the course Guarantees in Machine Learning by Prof. Fanny Yang at ETH Zurich. This note is mainly based on our slides and the textbook (High-Dimensional Statistics: A Non-Asymptotic Viewpoint by Martin J. Wainwright). The main purpose of writing this is to familiarize me with the concepts and mathematical derivations in the course. Therefore, I do not guarantee the correctness and completeness of it.
